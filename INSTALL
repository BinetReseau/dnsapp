Create a virtualenv:
  virtualenv -p python2.7 --no-site-package ../.dnsapp_venv

You may use --system-site-packages if you want Python global site-packages to
be used without special installation in your virtual environment.

Activate the venv:
  source ../.dnsapp_venv/bin/activate

Install requirements:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the database:
  make resetdb

You can now start the server with 'make run' and see your development site at http://127.0.0.1:8000
The django admin shell can be started with 'make shell' and the django admin site is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
